Originally written as a screen saver, I ported No Need for Crabs to webGL. I wanted to have my hand at a little webGL and it has become clear that screen savers are becoming a relic of the past so I did this port.

If you want to get the macOS screen saver, it is available here: https://github.com/noyhrynban/NoNeedForCrabs-macOS
